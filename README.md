# Medroutine

## Overview
MedRoutine is an app I designed to help people stick with their med therapy.
I also built a onepage - landing page that provides info about the app.
The website goes straight to the point: what features has the app? where can you download it?


## Style
The style is very simple and minimal. I used Illustrations by Storyset.com.
I also used the AOS library to add some animation on scroll.

## Built with

- css
